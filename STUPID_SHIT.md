# BROWSER MODULE - CODE ISSUES REPORT

## STATUS: FULLY RESOLVED ✅

### ✅ FIXED ISSUES:
- Fixed 6 broad exception handlers with specific types (NoSuchElementException, WebDriverException, etc.)
- Removed 5 unnecessary import order suppressions (# noqa: E402)
- Added proper logging for all exceptions
- Extracted hardcoded user agents to `backend/config/user_agents.json`
- Created CODE_EXCEPTIONS.md documenting legitimate patterns
- All unit tests passing (38 tests)

## NO REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES

All critical issues have been resolved. The following items are documented in CODE_EXCEPTIONS.md as legitimate patterns:

### Legitimate Patterns (Documented in CODE_EXCEPTIONS.md):
- **Download monitoring polling** - Chrome doesn't provide download events
- **Configurable delays** - All input/scroll delays use configurable parameters
- **Import order requirements** - Path setup scripts need sys.path modifications
- **Type ignores for CDP** - Selenium CDP commands lack proper type stubs
- **Screenshot stitching delays** - Required for proper rendering

### Low Priority Improvements (Optional):
- Consider refactoring methods with 31+ branches for maintainability
- Monitor file sizes (manager.py at 569 lines)
- Consider creating custom type stubs for CDP commands
