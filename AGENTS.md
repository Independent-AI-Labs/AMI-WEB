# Agent Guidelines

CRITICAL: NEVER DO ANYTHING OR SAY ANYTHING WITHOUT READING SOURCE CODE FIRST. NO INTERACTIONS, NO EDITS, NO ASSUMPTIONS. EVERYTHING IS FORBIDDEN UNTIL YOU READ THE RELEVANT SOURCE CODE. This is ABSOLUTE.

NO FUCKING DETACHED HEADS — WE ARE WORKING ONLY IN MAIN ALWAYS UNLESS I SAY OTHERWISE!!!!!!

Scope: This file applies to the entire AMI-ORCHESTRATOR repository and all directories under it, including submodules referenced by this repo.

Branch policy:
- Work only on branch `main` unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise.
- Never work on a detached HEAD. If you find yourself detached, switch to a named branch immediately.
- Submodules should also be on their respective `main` branches unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

Module restrictions:
- Do not modify ANY module directories (base, browser, compliance, domains, files, nodes, streams, ux, etc.) unless the user explicitly instructs you to.

Enforcement:
- `agent.sh` only prints an error when a detached HEAD is detected in the root repo or any submodule. It does not exit, and it does not enforce being on `main`.

Commit discipline:
- Do not bypass hooks (no `--no-verify`).
- Commit only after linters, type checks, and tests pass.
- Land work module-by-module (skip `ux` until the user says otherwise) so CI can start verifying while you keep moving; push after each clean chunk.
- Read the file before editing it. Open and inspect first, then apply changes with the appropriate tool (no blind scripting).
- Never build or wire "fallback" behaviour unless the user explicitly requests it for the current task. If a storage option (like the local file config) exists, treat it as opt-in and surface its use clearly instead of silently enabling it.

Testing discipline:
- Run each module's test suite using the module's script in `scripts/` (for example, `python3 scripts/run_tests.py`).
- Do not expect the root environment to install per-module dependencies; rely on module-level runners before committing.

Dependency review workflow:
- Query real registries before bumping anything. Use `python3 - <<'PY'` with `urllib.request` to read `https://pypi.org/pypi/<package>/json` for PyPI packages, and `npm view <package> version` (or `npx pnpm@<version> view`) for Node/Pnpm packages. Never guess or copy numbers from memory.
- Pin every dependency to an exact version in manifests and lockfiles (no `^`, `~`, or unbounded ranges). Update Python pins via `uv lock --refresh` or `uv sync`, and Node/Pnpm pins via `npm install` or `npx pnpm@<version> install` so lock files stay in sync.
- After bumping, run the module's setup (`python3 module_setup.py`) and its documented test runner. If the newest release is incompatible, use the latest compatible release and call out the constraint in your summary.
- Skip `domains/predict` during installs/tests; that module is deprecated and remains out of scope for dependency updates.

Compute profiles:
- Heavy compute stacks are opt-in. Set `AMI_COMPUTE_PROFILE` to `cpu`, `nvidia`, `intel`, or `amd` before running setup/tests if you genuinely need those wheels.
- Each module may provide `requirements.env.<profile>.txt`; never hardcode GPU/XPU packages outside those files.

Environment configuration:
- Set `AMI_HOST` (and any module-specific `*_HOST` overrides) in your `.env` when you need to point services at a different machine; defaults fall back to `127.0.0.1`.
- Populate `SSH_DEFAULT_USER` and `SSH_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` in your `.env` so the SSH MCP tests can log into your local machine; they should reference a real system account.
- Copy the updated `default.env` files (base/browser/domains/ux) and fill the auth stack variables: `DATAOPS_AUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATAOPS_AUTH_URL`, `DATAOPS_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, `SECRETS_BROKER_URL`, the broker tokens, and the `OPENBAO_*` settings that match your secrets instance. These must be valid before running auth or secrets tests.

Process management:
- Run `npm run dev` for the UX app in the background (for example, `npm run dev &`) or in a separate terminal since it blocks the current shell.

Reference code:
- `ux/ui-concept` is prototype/reference code; do not spend cycles fixing lint or build failures there unless explicitly asked.

Docker access:
- Add yourself to the `docker` group (`printf '%s\n' "$SUDO_PASS" | sudo -S usermod -aG docker $(whoami)`), then start a new shell (`newgrp docker`) before running compose commands.
- Bring the data stack up with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.yml up -d` and the auxiliary services with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.services.yml up -d` when tests require them.

Nodes setup automation:
- Use `python nodes/scripts/setup_service.py preinstall` before provisioning to run the shared preinstall checks.
- `python nodes/scripts/setup_service.py verify --no-tests` runs module setup; drop `--no-tests` to include each module's tests.
- Managed processes (docker/python/npm) are declared in `nodes/config/setup-service.yaml`; start or stop them via the CLI or the `NodeSetupMCP` server.
