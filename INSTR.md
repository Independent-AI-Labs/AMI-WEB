# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUATION AFTER SUDO REBOOT

## Current Status
We fixed config discrepancies between config.yaml and config.py:
1. ✅ Updated config.yaml to use separate chrome_binary_path and chromedriver_path fields
2. ✅ Set paths to macOS locations: Chrome at `/Users/vladislavdonchev/chrome/mac_arm-139.0.7258.66/chrome-mac-arm64/Google Chrome for Testing.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome for Testing` and ChromeDriver at `/usr/local/bin/chromedriver`
3. ✅ Updated config.py defaults to use "chrome" and "chromedriver" from PATH
4. ✅ Added chrome_options and MCP ping settings to config.py defaults
5. ✅ Fixed antidetect.py to create patched chromedriver in project's drivers/ directory
6. ✅ Fixed tests/conftest.py to load config.yaml

## Current Issue
- The patched chromedriver (`drivers/chromedriver_patched`) is being blocked by macOS Gatekeeper (exits with status -9)
- Need to test if running with sudo bypasses this restriction

## Next Steps After Sudo Reboot
1. Test if the patched chromedriver works with sudo:
   ```bash
   sudo drivers/chromedriver_patched --version
   ```

2. If it works with sudo, run the anti-detection test:
   ```bash
   sudo pytest tests/integration/test_antidetection.py::TestAntiDetection::test_first_tab_antidetection -xvs
   ```

3. If sudo doesn't help, consider these alternatives:
   - Option A: Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) temporarily for testing
   - Option B: Sign the patched binary with ad-hoc signature: `codesign --force --deep --sign - drivers/chromedriver_patched`
   - Option C: Modify anti-detection to skip binary patching on macOS and rely only on CDP commands and JS injection

4. After fixing anti-detection tests, run full test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```

5. Once all tests pass, commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix config discrepancies and update paths for macOS

   - Separate chrome_binary_path and chromedriver_path in config
   - Update default paths to use system PATH
   - Add chrome_options and MCP ping settings to defaults
   - Fix anti-detection chromedriver patching for macOS
   - Update tests to load config.yaml properly"
   ```

## Files Modified
- config.yaml
- chrome_manager/utils/config.py
- chrome_manager/core/antidetect.py
- chrome_manager/core/instance.py

## Requirements Still in Effect
- NEVER use --no-verify on commits
- Run pre-commit hooks before committing
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
