## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66 violation patterns with zero tolerance.

**PASS**

The code is clean and follows best practices:

1. **Exception handling is proper**: The code uses `contextlib.suppress` only for cleanup operations in `terminate()` (permitted exception per audit rules), and other exceptions are either propagated correctly or handled with appropriate logging.

2. **No SQL injection**: No database queries present.

3. **No security downgrades**: Security config is properly managed through `SecurityConfig` type.

4. **No sensitive data as plain text**: Uses proper types and configurations.

5. **No stub implementations**: All methods have real implementations.

6. **No lint suppression markers**: Clean code without `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, etc.

7. **Proper error propagation**: The `launch()` method catches exceptions, logs them, and re-raises as `InstanceError` with context preservation using `from e`.

8. **No sentinel returns from exceptions**: Methods either raise exceptions or return proper typed values.

9. **No shell operations**: No subprocess calls or shell command execution.

10. **Contextlib.suppress usage is legitimate**: Used only for cleanup operations (process termination, resource cleanup) in `terminate()` method, which is an explicitly permitted exception in the audit rules.

11. **No uncaught operations**: All risky operations are properly wrapped or handled.

12. **Type safety**: Proper type hints throughout, uses `| None` patterns correctly.

13. **No implicit defaults**: All defaults are explicit and documented.

14. **No partial success masking**: Operations either succeed or raise exceptions.

The code demonstrates enterprise-grade quality with proper composition pattern, clear separation of concerns, and robust error handling.
