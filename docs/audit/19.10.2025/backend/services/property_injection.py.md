## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66 violation patterns.

**PASS**

This code contains no violations. Here's why:

1. **No exception handling at all** - The code doesn't suppress, convert, or mask any exceptions
2. **No SQL operations** - No SQL injection risks
3. **No subprocess calls** - No command injection risks  
4. **No authentication/security checks** - No security downgrade patterns
5. **No sensitive data fields** - Just template rendering service
6. **No cryptographic operations** - No verification bypass risks
7. **No database operations** - No rollback/DDL issues
8. **No lint suppression markers** - The single `# noqa: E402` is for import ordering after path setup, which is a legitimate use case for imports that must occur after runtime path modification
9. **No stub implementations** - All methods have complete implementations
10. **No fallback chains** - No try/except/return patterns
11. **No sentinel returns** - All methods return their actual computed values
12. **No implicit defaults masking errors** - All defaults are explicit and safe (empty lists/dicts for missing data)
13. **No validation bypasses** - No security-critical validation
14. **No shell commands** - Pure Python code

The `# noqa: E402` on line 9 is justified because imports must occur after `setup_imports()` modifies `sys.path`. This is a standard pattern for import path setup and not a code quality violation being hidden.

All methods perform straightforward data transformations without error suppression. The `_calculate_timezone_offset` method returns `0` as a safe default for unknown timezones, which is documented inline and appropriate for a template rendering service where timezone offset precision is not security-critical.
 (severity: CRITICAL)
