## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code for violations according to the comprehensive violation patterns provided.

Let me examine the code systematically:

1. **Exception handling**: Checking all try/except blocks and exception patterns
2. **Default values and fallbacks**: Looking for implicit defaults and fallback chains
3. **Security patterns**: SQL injection, input validation, sensitive data handling
4. **Suppression markers**: Checking for lint/type suppressions
5. **Resource handling**: Cleanup and error propagation
6. **Return patterns**: Looking for sentinel values, boolean returns from exceptions

**Analysis:**

- Line 91: `except Exception as e:` followed by `logger.debug(f"Failed to resolve URL {href}: {e}")` - This is **Exception → logger.error/warning/debug() Without Raise** (Pattern #39). The exception is suppressed via logging only, and execution continues.

- Line 295: `def _matches(node_text: str | None) -> bool:` - Returns `False` for `None` input, then searches with pattern. This is acceptable defensive programming.

- Line 58: `for comment in soup.find_all(string=lambda text: isinstance(text, Comment)):` - Safe iterator pattern.

- Line 86-92: URL resolution with exception suppression:
```python
try:
    if not href.startswith(("http://", "https://", "//", "mailto:", "tel:", "#")):
        href = urljoin(base_url, href)
except Exception as e:
    logger.debug(f"Failed to resolve URL {href}: {e}")
```
This catches `Exception` (too broad), logs it, and continues execution. The failure is completely hidden from the caller - the URL remains unresolved but no indication of failure is provided.

**VIOLATION FOUND:**
- **Pattern #39**: Exception → logger.error() Without Raise (Line 86-92)
- **Impact**: URL resolution failures are suppressed via logging only, failures hidden, execution continues after error with potentially malformed URLs

FAIL: Line 91: Exception → logger.debug() Without Raise (Pattern #39) - URL resolution exception suppressed, no error propagation, caller cannot detect failed URL resolution
 (severity: CRITICAL)
