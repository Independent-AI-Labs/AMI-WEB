**File**: `backend/mcp/chrome/tools/facade/execution.py`
**Status**: FAIL
**Audit Date**: 2025-10-19 15:02:05
**Execution Time**: 13.73s

## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I need to analyze this code for any of the 66+ violation patterns listed in the audit instructions.

Let me examine the code systematically:

## Analysis

### Exception Handling
- No try/except blocks present
- All function calls are awaited without exception handling (lines 49, 51, 53, 54)

### Critical Patterns Check
1. ✗ SQL Injection: Not applicable (no SQL)
2. ✗ Subprocess fallbacks: Not applicable (no subprocess)
3. ✗ Auth downgrade: Not applicable (no auth)
4. ✗ Missing security attributes: Not applicable (no security fields)
5. ✗ Sensitive data plain text: Not applicable (no sensitive data storage)
6. ✗ Crypto verification: Not applicable (no crypto)
7. ✗ Verification without exception: Not applicable (no verification)
8. ✗ Stub/No-op: Not applicable (delegates to implementations)
9. ✗ Rollback suppression: Not applicable (no transactions)
10. ✗ Uncaught DDL: Not applicable (no database)
11. ✗ Lint suppression markers: **None found** ✓
12. ✗ Disabled security checks: Not applicable (no security checks)

### High Severity Patterns Check
- Pattern #25: **Missing Exception Handling** - Lines 49, 51, 53, 54 call async functions without try/except wrappers
  - `browser_execute_chunk_tool()` - could raise exceptions
  - `browser_execute_impl()` - could raise exceptions  
  - `browser_evaluate_chunk_tool()` - could raise exceptions
  - `browser_evaluate_tool()` - could raise exceptions

These are risky operations (browser automation, code execution) that could fail due to:
- Browser connection failures
- JavaScript execution errors
- Network issues
- Invalid code/arguments

### Other Patterns
- No exception suppression
- No sentinel returns
- No fallback chains
- No silent failures in loops
- No uncaught conversions

## Verdict

**FAIL: Line 49: Missing exception handling (browser_execute_chunk_tool); Line 51: Missing exception handling (browser_execute_impl); Line 53: Missing exception handling (browser_evaluate_chunk_tool); Line 54: Missing exception handling (browser_evaluate_tool)**
 (severity: CRITICAL)
