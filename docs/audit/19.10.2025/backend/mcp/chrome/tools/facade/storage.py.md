## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66+ violation patterns with zero tolerance.

```
FAIL: Line 11 (noqa suppression markers); Line 92-95 (Exception â†’ logger.error without raise); Line 116-119 (Warning + Continue in Loop - delete failures suppressed)
```

**Detailed violations:**

1. **Line 11**: `# noqa: C901, PLR0911, PLR0912` - Lint suppression markers (Pattern #11 - CRITICAL)

2. **Lines 92-95**: Exception suppression via logger.error
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to set download behavior: {e}")
    return BrowserResponse(success=False, error=f"Failed to set download behavior: {e}")
```
Pattern #39 (HIGH) - Exception caught, logged, but converted to error response instead of propagating. Breaks exception handling chain.

3. **Lines 116-119**: Warning + Continue in Loop (delete failures)
```python
try:
    file.unlink()
    count += 1
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to delete {file}: {e}")
```
Pattern #24 (HIGH) - File deletion failures suppressed with warning only, loop continues. Partial success returned without tracking which deletions failed. Also Pattern #23 (Partial Success Count-Based).
 (severity: CRITICAL)
