## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66+ violation patterns from the audit specification.

Reading the source code:

The code provides JavaScript injection prevention utilities with four functions:
1. `sanitize_js_string()` - escapes special characters
2. `build_js_function_call()` - builds JS function calls with escaped args
3. `safe_js_property_access()` - validates property paths and raises ValueError for invalid input
4. `parameterized_js_execution()` - template-based JS code generation with parameter escaping

Checking against all violation patterns:

**Critical Severity (1-12)**: No SQL injection, subprocess calls, auth fallbacks, missing security attributes, plain-text sensitive data, cryptographic operations, verification methods, stubs, rollbacks, DDL operations, or suppression markers.

**High Severity (13-53)**: No shell commands, exception suppression, import failures, data integrity issues, contextlib.suppress, sentinel returns from exceptions, try/except blocks converting exceptions to False/None/sentinels, missing exception handling on risky operations, or uncaught operations.

**Medium Severity (54-66)**: No exit code handling, git operations, implicit defaults via truthiness, TODO comments, cleanup suppression, or hardcoded retry logic.

**Additional Common Violations**: No environment variables, test-specific issues, retry/fallback chains, health checks, or uncaught type conversions.

**Validation Methods Analysis**:
- `safe_js_property_access()` raises `ValueError` for invalid input (lines 71, 84, 88, 92) - this is CORRECT behavior. Validation methods SHOULD raise exceptions, not return False.
- No exception â†’ False/None/sentinel patterns present.

**All code paths**:
- Type checking uses `isinstance()` - no exceptions raised
- String operations use `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.isalnum()`, `.isdigit()` - no exceptions raised from these
- `json.dumps()` is called but for simple lists/dicts this is safe in context
- All exception raising is intentional validation (ValueError for security)

No violations detected.

PASS
 (severity: CRITICAL)
