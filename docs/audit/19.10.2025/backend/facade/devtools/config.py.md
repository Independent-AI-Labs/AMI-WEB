## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I need to analyze this code against the comprehensive violation patterns.

Let me examine the code systematically:

## Analysis

**Line 18-22: `_load_user_agents_config()` function**
```python
def _load_user_agents_config() -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Load user agents configuration from JSON file."""
    config_path = MODULE_ROOT / "config" / "user_agents.json"
    if config_path.exists():
        with config_path.open() as f:
            data: dict[str, Any] = json.load(f)
            return data
    return {"presets": {}, "device_emulation": {}}
```

### Violations Found:

1. **Line 21: Violation #50 - Uncaught JSON Parsing**
   - `json.load(f)` has no try/except wrapper
   - Malformed JSON will cause `json.JSONDecodeError` to propagate uncaught
   - Impact: JSON decode errors unhandled, malformed input causes exceptions

2. **Line 22: Violation #34 - Resource Not Found → Sentinel Return**
   - Returns `{"presets": {}, "device_emulation": {}}` when file doesn't exist
   - Missing file treated as normal flow with empty dictionary
   - Caller cannot distinguish between missing file and valid empty config
   - Impact: Missing resources treated as normal flow

3. **Lines 10-11: Violation #11 - Lint Suppression Markers**
   - `# noqa: N815` on lines 10 and 11 (deviceScaleFactor and userAgent)
   - Code quality issues hidden from static analysis
   - Impact: Violations allowed to persist

**Line 115: `get_device_config()` function**
```python
def get_device_config(device_name: str) -> DeviceEmulation | None:
    """Get device configuration by name.
    ...
    Returns:
        DeviceEmulation config or None if not found
    """
    return DEVICE_CONFIGS.get(device_name)
```

4. **Line 121: Violation #64 - Dictionary .get() Silent None Return**
   - `DEVICE_CONFIGS.get(device_name)` returns None if missing
   - However, this is documented as permitted per exception rule #2 ("Returns None if Not Found")
   - **BUT** the docstring says "or None if not found" which is the permitted pattern
   - This specific case is PERMITTED

## Verdict

FAIL: Line 21: Uncaught JSON Parsing; Line 22: Resource Not Found → Sentinel Return; Lines 10-11: Lint Suppression Markers
 (severity: CRITICAL)
