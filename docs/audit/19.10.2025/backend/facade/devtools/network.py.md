## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66 violation patterns in the zero-tolerance policy.

**FAIL: Line 92: Pattern #24 (Warning + Continue in Loop); Line 97: Pattern #17 (Exception → Empty Collection Return)**

**Detailed violations:**

1. **Lines 88-93** - Pattern #24 (Warning + Continue in Loop):
```python
except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:
    logger.debug(f"Failed to parse log entry: {e}")
    continue
```
Individual log parsing failures are hidden in iteration. Partial completion is masked. No exception propagation for malformed network logs.

2. **Lines 96-97** - Pattern #17 (Exception → Empty Collection Return):
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to get network logs: {e}")
    return []
```
Method fails silently by returning empty list. Caller cannot distinguish between "no network activity" and "failed to retrieve logs". Exception is suppressed and converted to empty collection sentinel.

**Impact:**
- Network monitoring failures appear as "no activity detected"
- Individual malformed log entries are silently skipped
- Caller has no way to detect retrieval failures
- System appears to work correctly while network monitoring is broken
 (severity: CRITICAL)
