- Line 0: I'll analyze this test code against the comprehensive violation patterns.

```
PASS
```

This test file demonstrates good practices:

1. **No exception suppression** - All test cases properly assert on `response.success` and `response.error`, validating error paths explicitly
2. **No sentinel returns from exceptions** - Error handling is done through the response object pattern with explicit success/error fields
3. **No fallback chains** - Each test validates a single code path
4. **Proper error validation** - Tests check for specific error messages and conditions
5. **No lint suppressions** - No `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, or similar markers
6. **No stub implementations** - All mocked methods have explicit behavior via `return_value` or `side_effect`
7. **Proper async/await usage** - All async operations properly awaited
8. **Good test isolation** - Each test creates its own mocks and doesn't share state
9. **Explicit assertions** - Tests verify both success and failure cases with specific assertions
10. **No validation-to-boolean patterns** - Uses response objects with structured error reporting

The test `test_terminate_still_terminates_if_save_fails` is particularly well-written - it validates that even when `save_session` fails with an exception, the termination still proceeds and returns a structured response indicating the save failure rather than suppressing the error.
 (severity: CRITICAL)
