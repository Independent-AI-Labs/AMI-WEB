## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66+ violation patterns.

**Analyzing conftest.py line by line...**

Checking for:
1. Exception handlers and suppression
2. Sentinel returns
3. Default values and implicit fallbacks
4. Security patterns
5. SQL injection
6. Stub implementations
7. Loop error handling
8. Validation patterns
9. Type safety
10. All other violation patterns

**Analysis:**

This file contains **only test fixtures** that:
- Return mock objects (explicitly documented as test fixtures)
- Return sample data for testing
- Define a mock transport class for testing
- Have no exception handling (not needed in fixtures)
- Have no security-sensitive operations
- Have no SQL queries
- Have no validation logic
- Have no production code patterns

All fixtures are properly typed and documented.

The `MockTransport` class:
- Has simple mock methods
- Uses proper async/await
- No exception suppression
- No sentinel returns from exceptions
- No validation logic that could fail

**Permitted under "Test Fixtures" exception:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_cookies() -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Sample cookies for testing."""
    return [...]  # OK - test fixture
```

No violations detected in any of the 66+ patterns.
