## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this test file against all 66+ violation patterns.

**ANALYSIS:**

Examining all exception handlers: None present in test code.

Examining all loops: None present.

Examining all default values and return statements: Test functions return None implicitly (standard pytest behavior).

Examining all mocking patterns: Uses proper `unittest.mock.patch` and `MagicMock`.

Examining all assertions: All assertions are explicit and validate concrete behavior.

Examining import statements: No try/except around imports, no import fallbacks.

Examining type conversions: `str()` calls are safe (converting Path objects to strings for config).

Examining subprocess calls: None present.

Examining database/SQL operations: None present.

Examining security patterns: None present (this is test code).

Examining lint suppression markers: None present.

Examining validation patterns: Uses proper assertions, no boolean returns from validation.

Examining error handling: No exception handlers present in code.

Examining fallback chains: None present.

Examining sentinel returns: None present.

**KEY OBSERVATIONS:**

1. Test functions return None implicitly - this is standard pytest behavior and acceptable for test functions
2. All mocking is explicit and properly configured
3. Assertions validate concrete behavior without fallbacks
4. No exception suppression, no fallback chains, no sentinel returns
5. No violations of any of the 66+ patterns identified in the audit rules

**VERDICT:**

PASS
 (severity: CRITICAL)
