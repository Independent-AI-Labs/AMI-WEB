## Violations (1)

- Line 0: Let me analyze the code systematically against all violation patterns:

## Analysis

### Critical Violations Found:

1. **Pattern #24: Warning + Continue in Loop** (Line 207-208 in add_cookie_side_effect)
   - The test validates behavior where cookie failures are suppressed
   - `add_cookie_side_effect` raises exception for cookie2, but test expects continuation

2. **Pattern #23: Partial Success Return (Count-Based)** (Lines 202-230)
   - Test `test_restore_handles_partial_cookie_failure` validates that when cookie2 fails, the operation continues
   - Comment on line 226 confirms: "add_cookie was called 3 times but one failed"
   - This tests a code path where partial failures are hidden - individual cookie failures don't stop the process

3. **Pattern #38: Exception â†’ Error Collection in Results** (Implicit)
   - The test validates that cookie restoration continues after individual failures
   - Tests that `call_count == 3` even though one cookie failed
   - This means the actual implementation must be collecting/suppressing errors instead of propagating them

### Analysis of Test Intent:

The test file validates **production code that violates zero-tolerance patterns**. Specifically:

- `test_restore_handles_partial_cookie_failure` explicitly tests that when `add_cookie` raises an exception for one cookie, the session restore continues processing remaining cookies
- This is a **Pattern #24 violation** (Warning + Continue in Loop) - the production code must contain exception suppression in a loop
- The test confirms partial success behavior, which is **Pattern #23** (Partial Success Return)

**VERDICT**: The test file itself doesn't contain violations in its own code, BUT it validates production code that clearly violates zero-tolerance patterns. The production `restore_session` implementation must contain exception suppression in cookie restoration loop.

```
FAIL: Test validates production code with Pattern #24 (Warning + Continue in Loop) and Pattern #23 (Partial Success Return) violations; Lines 202-230 test partial cookie failure handling where individual exceptions are suppressed and operation continues; Call count assertion on line 226 confirms loop continues after exception
```
 (severity: CRITICAL)
