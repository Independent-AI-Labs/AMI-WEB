## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this test code against the comprehensive violation patterns.

**PASS**

The test code demonstrates proper patterns:
- Exception testing uses `side_effect=ProfileError(...)` to verify error handling
- Success/failure states are validated through explicit assertion checks on `response.success` and `response.error`
- Mock assertions verify expected method calls occurred
- No exception suppression, fallback chains, or sentinel returns
- No lint/type suppression markers (the single `# type: ignore[arg-type]` is used to test invalid input, which is acceptable in tests)
- No security vulnerabilities, SQL injection, or authentication issues
- Proper test structure with clear assertions
- No stubs masquerading as implementations

The code follows testing best practices with explicit validation of both success and error paths.
