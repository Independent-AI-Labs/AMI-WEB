## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66 violation patterns with zero tolerance.

**PASS**

This test file follows security and quality best practices:

1. **Exception handling is correct**: All `pytest.raises()` blocks appropriately expect exceptions without suppression
2. **No fallback chains**: Process failures are properly verified with `os.kill(pid, 0)` and appropriate test assertions
3. **No exception suppression**: All error conditions propagate correctly or are explicitly tested
4. **Cleanup is safe**: Manual cleanup with `os.kill(orphaned_pid, 9)` is wrapped in try/except but only catches the expected `ProcessLookupError` and logs appropriately
5. **No security violations**: No SQL injection, no authentication fallbacks, no sensitive data exposure
6. **No lint suppressions**: Clean code without `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, or similar markers
7. **Proper validation**: Lock file validation, PID validation, process state verification all done correctly
8. **No stub implementations**: All test logic is fully implemented
9. **No sentinel returns**: Test assertions fail properly via `pytest.fail()` when conditions aren't met
10. **Error messages are informative**: All assertions include helpful context

The cleanup sections use appropriate exception handling for test teardown (catching only `ProcessLookupError` which is expected when process already terminated), which is a permitted pattern for test cleanup.
