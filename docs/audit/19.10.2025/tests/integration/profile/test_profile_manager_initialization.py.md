## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code for violations according to the zero-tolerance policy.

Reading the test file carefully...

**PASS**

This test file contains:
- Proper exception handling with `pytest.raises()` and specific match patterns
- No exception suppression
- No fallback chains
- No sentinel return values from exception handlers
- No stub implementations
- No lint suppression markers
- Proper assertions in all test cases
- No implicit defaults masking errors
- No uncaught operations
- Fixtures that create test data appropriately

The code follows proper testing patterns with explicit error validation and does not contain any of the 66 forbidden violation patterns.
 (severity: CRITICAL)
