## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I apologize for the confusion. Based on the context provided, you want me to audit code, but the snippet shown is incomplete. Let me search the local codebase for files containing that docstring. However, I realize I should ask directly: **which file should I audit?**

Looking at the git status, I see several new test files. The most likely candidate based on the docstring would be in the `tests/` directory. Without the complete file path or content, I cannot perform the audit.

**Please provide either:**
1. The complete file path to audit
2. The complete file content to audit

Once you provide this, I will perform a comprehensive audit against all 66+ violation patterns with zero tolerance.
