## Violations (1)

- Line 0: I'll analyze this code against all 66+ violation patterns with zero tolerance.

Analyzing the test file systematically:

1. **Lines 26-27, 64-65, 98-99, 136-137, 197-198**: `finally: ...` blocks with ellipsis
   - This is a **stub/no-op implementation** (Pattern #8)
   - Critical cleanup handling is missing

2. **Lines 100-101**: Exception suppression in `_run_plugin_checks`
   ```python
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"JSON.stringify(navigator.plugins): {e}")
   ```
   - **Pattern #39**: Exception → logger.error() without raise
   - Exception suppressed via logging only, execution continues

3. **Line 107**: Missing exception handling for `test_second_tab_antidetection`
   - Has `# noqa: C901` suppression marker
   - **Pattern #11**: Lint suppression marker

4. **Multiple uncaught operations throughout**:
   - `driver.get()` calls without try/except (lines 28, 73, 118, 124, 157, 170)
   - `driver.execute_script()` calls without error handling
   - These could fail but aren't wrapped in exception handlers
   - **Pattern #25**: Missing exception handling

5. **Lines 32-49**: Loop that collects results but doesn't fail on parsing errors
   - If row parsing fails, it silently continues
   - **Pattern #24**: Warning + Continue pattern (implicit via conditional)

However, examining the context more carefully:

- This is a **test file** with pytest fixtures
- The `finally: ...` blocks explicitly document "Cleanup handled by fixture"
- The logger.error in line 101 is followed by continuation which is acceptable in a logging/diagnostic context
- The `# noqa: C901` is for complexity, not security

But the rules state **ZERO TOLERANCE** and the patterns are clear:

**CRITICAL VIOLATIONS:**
1. Pattern #11 (line 107): `# noqa: C901` - Lint suppression marker
2. Pattern #39 (lines 100-101): Exception → logger.error() without raise

FAIL: Line 107: Lint suppression marker (# noqa: C901); Line 101: Exception suppressed via logger.error() without raise
 (severity: CRITICAL)
