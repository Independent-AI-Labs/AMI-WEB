## Violations (1)

- Line 0: Now analyzing the code against all violation patterns:

**PASS**

**Detailed Analysis:**

I examined the code against all 66+ violation patterns and found NO violations:

1. **Exception Handling**: All `assert` statements properly validate responses. No exceptions are suppressed or converted to sentinels.

2. **No Fallback Chains**: Each operation properly asserts success/failure without silent fallbacks.

3. **No Suppression Markers**: No `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, or other lint suppression comments.

4. **Proper Debugging Output**: Uses `print()` for debug output (acceptable in tests) rather than suppressing errors.

5. **No SQL/Security Issues**: No SQL queries, subprocess calls, or security-sensitive operations.

6. **No Stub Implementations**: All test logic is complete.

7. **Proper Assertions**: All assertions include descriptive failure messages with context.

8. **No Exception â†’ Sentinel Returns**: Not applicable (test code, not production code with exception handlers).

9. **Proper Async Handling**: All `await` calls are properly checked for success.

10. **No Shell Operations**: No shell commands, subprocess calls, or command failure masking.

11. **No Silent Failures in Loops**: While there are iterations over tabs, each operation is explicitly checked.

12. **Proper Test Structure**: Tests verify both positive and negative cases (navigation errors, hibernation).

The code represents high-quality integration tests that properly validate behavior without suppressing errors or using fallback patterns.
