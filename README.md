**Complete control over every browser parameter with undetectable automation for enterprise applications**

![](res/notbot.png)

AMI-WEB provides organizations with comprehensive browser automation that offers full control over WebGL, Canvas, Audio, WebRTC, and all browser fingerprinting parameters. Built for enterprises requiring compliant web automation, security testing, and AI-powered browser interactions.

## üéØ Key Differentiators

### Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

**üîê Complete Browser Control** - Full manipulation of every browser parameter including user agents, fingerprints, viewport settings, timezone, language, plugins, and hardware specifications.

**üè¢ Multi-Profile Management** - Create, manage, and isolate browser profiles with persistent cookies, localStorage, and session data. Run multiple identities simultaneously with complete isolation.

**üìä Real-Time Monitoring** - Hook into console logs, network requests, performance metrics, and browser events through Chrome DevTools Protocol integration.

**ü§ñ AI-Native Architecture** - Native Model Context Protocol (MCP) support enables Claude, GPT, and custom AI agents to control browsers through natural language.

**‚úÖ Compliance & Auditability** - Full activity logging, session recording, and audit trails for regulatory compliance and security reviews.

- **Event-Driven Core** - Reactive architecture with no polling

### Integration Options
```python
# Python SDK
from backend.core.management.manager import ChromeManager

manager = ChromeManager()
await manager.initialize()

# Launch with full control
browser = await manager.get_or_create_instance(
    profile="production_profile",
    anti_detect=True
)
```

```json
// AI Agent Configuration (Claude Desktop)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ami-web": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["scripts/start_mcp_server.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/AMI-WEB"
    }
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Running

### Docker
